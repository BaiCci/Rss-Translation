                <title>Data management challenges in M&A</title>
                <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/148gi85/data_management_challenges_in_ma/</link>
                <description><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My company has recently gone through a merger. My team and I, an executive of the company, faced many issues that took too much time to solve. That got me thinking: how many other executives and team leads out there will have to struggle through the same issues, and how can I help them prepare? This is why I gathered some useful information that I believe could be useful for many people.<br /> Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) bring about significant shifts in operations and culture for employees and the impact of data-related challenges on these aspects is frequently overlooked. Ensure you or your company are not making the same mistake.<br /> Mergers and acquisitions often trigger substantial organizational uncertainty about what lies ahead: typically, the operational model and culture undergo significant transformations for one or both of the merging entities. These alterations extend beyond just a new name and executive leadership; first and foremost, M&amp;A change the way IT teams work. Anticipating and addressing these IT challenges can pave the way for smooth and efficient integration. Conversely, failure to foresee and manage these issues can result in poor business performance, attrition of key talent, and potential data breaches. In this article, experts from AINSYS delve into the IT complications that can emerge during and post M&amp;A, and provide tools for addressing them effectively.<br /> During and after M&amp;A, two companies’ tech stacks essentially collide, and IT management has to deal with a number of challenges:</p> <h1>1. Integrating disparate systems and platforms</h1> <p>Integrating disparate systems and platforms is one of the most significant challenges during mergers and acquisitions. When two companies come together, they often bring with them different IT systems and platforms that have been tailored to their specific business processes and needs. These systems can range from customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, to data management platforms, financial systems, and more.<br /> Here are some of the key issues that arise during this integration process:<br /> - Compatibility: the systems used by the merging companies may not be compatible. They may be built on different architectures, use different data formats, or be based on different technologies. This can make integration a complex and time-consuming process;<br /> - Data Consistency: each system may have its own way of storing and structuring data. Ensuring consistency in data definitions, formats, and structures across all systems is crucial to avoid confusion and errors in data analysis and decision-making;<br /> - Redundancy: there may be significant overlap in the functionality of the systems used by the two companies, leading to redundancy. Identifying and eliminating these redundancies is important to avoid unnecessary costs and complexity;<br /> - Security and Compliance: each system will have its own security measures and compliance requirements. Ensuring that the integrated system meets all necessary security standards and regulatory requirements is crucial;<br /> - User Training: Employees from each company will be familiar with their own systems, but may need training to use the new integrated system effectively;<br /> System Performance: Integrating two systems can put a strain on the performance of the IT infrastructure. Ensuring the integrated system performs effectively without causing downtime or delays is important.</p> <h1>2. Reconciling different data formats and standards</h1> <p>When two companies merge, they bring with them different data systems that have been tailored to their specific needs and processes. These systems may use different data formats and adhere to different data standards, which can create several issues during integration, including data inconsistency, data loss (if one system uses a data format that the other system does not support, some data may be lost during the conversion process, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data in the integrated system), data quality (one system might allow for missing values in certain fields, while the other does not), and compliance issues.</p> <h1>3. Significant differences in the technological maturity between the two companies</h1> <p>If one of the companies has a significant technological advantage over the other, several issues may arise:<br /> - Integration Complexity: if one company uses modern, cloud-based systems while the other still relies on legacy systems, integrating the two can be complex and time-consuming. It may require significant resources to upgrade or replace outdated systems;<br /> - Operational Disruptions: if one company’s systems are automated and the other’s are manual, it could disrupt business processes and workflows until the less advanced systems are upgraded;<br /> - Security Risks: Older, less advanced systems may have more vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of data breaches or cyberattacks. It’s crucial to assess and address these risks as part of the integration process.</p> <h1>4. Considering the human element</h1> <p>This is perhaps the most complex and difficult issue to solve, seeing as no specialist is alike and supporting employees through change in M&amp;A is the most important matter you will need to solve. Why is that? Well, the reason is that the success of any merger or acquisition is not just about integrating systems and processes, but also about bringing together people from different organizational cultures. Employees are the backbone of any organization, and their acceptance and adaptation to change can significantly impact the outcome of the M&amp;A.<br /> The problem is, employees are conservative and don’t want to switch from systems they have been using for years, having to learn new skills to actually use them. Additionally, companies often have to hire additional employees or IT consultants in order to support them through the process.<br /> And it is not like executives can allow their employees to take their sweet time to figure out a whole new way of doing things – they need to start profiting from the merger or acquisition as soon as possible.<br /> Merging or acquiring companies must shift the day-to-day behavior and mind-sets of their employees to protect a deal’s sources of value, both financial and organizational, and to make changes sustainable. Yet when McKinsey asked 3,199 leaders if they regarded the change programs at their own companies as successful, only one-third did.<br /> In fact, comprehensive change management strategies are vital in easing transitions during mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), as they help increase acceptance among employees and minimize potential disruption. Here’s how these strategies can be applied:<br /> - Implement Surveys for In-depth Understanding: confidential surveys can encourage employees to express concerns they might not voice in person. These surveys should be designed to address specific issues identified during the interviews, such as opportunities for promotion. The responses can provide a more detailed understanding of the company’s situation;<br /> - Compile and Present a Detailed Report to Stakeholders: the findings from the interviews and surveys should be compiled into a comprehensive report. This report should highlight both the positive aspects and potential issues within the company, such as knowledge gaps or cultural problems. The report should be presented to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner;<br /> - Include Personalized Action Plans in the Report: the report should also contain personalized action plans for key tasks. This assigns responsibility and accountability, ensuring that important tasks are not overlooked. A well-implemented action plan can drive value-generating changes in the company;<br /> Perform a Potential Resistance Analysis: a potential resistance analysis can identify potential obstacles within both organizations involved in the acquisition. This step should avoid creating a divisive ‘us versus them’ mentality. Instead, it should focus on understanding employee concerns, perceived negatives of the deal, and their vision of their future roles in the company. This analysis can help drive the acquisition forward in a positive and inclusive manner.<br /> Other issues can be solved via the right tool that addresses every issue mentioned. </p> <h1>How to effectively address data-related M&amp;A challenges?</h1> <p>To effectively address the challenges posed by M&amp;A, a comprehensive approach is required that addresses not only the technical aspects but also the human element. A no-code data sync and integration solution that serves as a central source of truth can be the key to this approach. This solution would transform data into a uniform format and securely store it in a single data warehouse, simplifying the integration process and ensuring data consistency and security.<br /> A central source of truth (CSOT) is a concept in data management that refers to a single, authoritative source of data that everyone in the organization agrees is the real, trusted number. In the context of M&amp;A, a CSOT can help eliminate data inconsistencies and redundancies, streamline data management, and ensure all employees have access to the same, accurate data.<br /> By transforming all data into the same format, a CSOT can help to overcome the challenges of integrating disparate systems and reconciling different data formats and standards. No code aspect of the tool can significantly reduce the complexity and time required for data integration by involving business in the process. This ensures that all data is consistent and reliable.<br /> Moreover, by storing all data securely in one data warehouse, a CSOT can help to maintain data privacy and security during and after the M&amp;A process. This can help to prevent data breaches and ensure compliance with all relevant regulations.</p> <h1>No-Code Data Solutions</h1> <p>No-code data solutions can play a crucial role in integrating two systems. These solutions allow users to manage and manipulate data without needing to write any code, making them accessible to both IT specialists and employees with no coding experience. This can help to speed up the integration process and enable companies to start profiting from M&amp;A right away.<br /> Furthermore, by enabling non-technical employees to work with data, no-code solutions can help to address the human element of M&amp;A. They can get more employees on board with adopting new systems and for them to adapt to new workflows. This can help to reduce resistance to change and increase employee engagement and productivity.</p> <p>In addition, no-code solutions can reduce the need to hire IT consultants or spend time figuring out the best IT architecture option. This can result in significant cost savings and allow companies to focus their resources on other aspects of the M&amp;A process.<br /> The rest of research can be found here: <a href="https://ainsys.com/blog/2023/06/12/data-management-challenges-in-ma/?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=automation&amp;utm_content=migrations_acquistions&amp;utm_term=ITarchitecture">https://ainsys.com/blog/2023/06/12/data-management-challenges-in-ma/?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=automation&amp;utm_content=migrations_acquistions&amp;utm_term=ITarchitecture</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Speech36"> /u/Competitive_Speech36 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/148gi85/data_management_challenges_in_ma/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/148gi85/data_management_challenges_in_ma/">[comments]</a></span></description>

                <title>How CIOs approach automation</title>
                <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/146zizf/how_cios_approach_automation/</link>
                <description><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Chief Information Officers (CIO) lead the charge in implementing cutting-edge automation initiatives that not only work in the present but also safeguard the future. But success is far from guaranteed - the key lies in establishing a rock-solid business case from the outset. </p> <p>The real challenge here is ensuring that processes that require modernization and automation align with the end goal of operational efficiency. For years, organizations have strived to modernize their core systems for optimal performance, but all too often, the business case falls short. This article delves into the critical importance of a robust business case for streamlining and automating processes - ultimately leading to an improved end-user experience.</p> <h2>CIOs on automation</h2> <p>Automation is a critical tool in any CIO's arsenal, as it can help improve KPIs and create new channels to enhance the end-user experience. </p> <p>However, ensuring that automation doesn't simply put a band-aid on legacy, bureaucratic manual processes is crucial. Short-term gains are not enough - durable value must be delivered. As one of AINSYS experts put it, automation cannot be done to the business but must be done with it. Let's take a look at a few examples: </p> <ul> <li>At Cardinal Health, a healthcare provider, the IT department closely collaborates with business leaders to identify pain points and determine the right processes to automate. The impact of automation initiatives is quantified through before-and-after business metrics, and an agile and innovative approach enables quick pivots in a dynamic healthcare environment. </li> <li>CIOs in financial institutions face the challenge of redefining entire business processes while delighting clients and maintaining compliance. The benefits of combining automation with AI are clear - faster decisions, optimized processes, and higher efficiency rates. Ultimately, businesses must prioritize the central consideration of automation efforts: the company itself. </li> <li>At Northwestern Mutual, the mission to alleviate financial anxiety drives all business priorities, with automation solutions applied where they can have a meaningful impact and be measured by business outcomes.</li> </ul> <h2>CIOs' priorities</h2> <p>The priorities of CIOs are clear: automation of complex workflows is essential for business success. Let's see what these specialists say about automation:</p> <ol> <li>Petr Baudis, CTO and chief AI architect at Rossum, predicts that AI-enabled data capture will help enterprises scale automation projects beyond departmental silos. He suggests fast and accurate data extraction is foundational to business intelligence and data analytics, enabling better collaboration and B2B communications. RPA, process, and task mining are seen as vital automation technologies as enterprises attempt to scale their automation projects;</li> <li>Other companies are making significant progress in automation as well. Adani Electricity is implementing advanced distribution management and a cloud-based data lake and analytics solution to improve the customer experience. The company has also improved its forecast accuracy with SAS' AI/ML-based energy forecasting solution, reducing estimated readings for customers from 2.2% to 0.3%;</li> <li>At Cardinal Health, warehouse automation is a top priority to serve customers better. The University of Phoenix is developing an enterprise platform that will enable increased use of ML and automation across a wide range of student and staff journeys, providing truly individualized student support.</li> </ol> <p>CIOs also recognize that automation combined with AI has the potential to improve business KPIs through auto-detect and auto-heal solutions, as well as create new channels to enhance the end-user experience. To ensure that automation projects are effective, CIOs must prioritize infrastructure as code, continuous integration and deployment, and AI operations. By automating increasingly complex tasks in matriculation, transcript processing, and student financial aid, CIOs are creating platforms and systems that scale and govern automation safely and reliably, ultimately improving business processes and driving higher efficiency rates.</p> <p>I share these and other tips on building robust IT architecture in my blog: <a href="https://ainsys.com/blog/2023/03/15/cios-automation/?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=automation&amp;utm_content=automation_approach&amp;utm_term=Automation">https://ainsys.com/blog/2023/03/15/cios-automation/?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=automation&amp;utm_content=automation_approach&amp;utm_term=Automation</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Speech36"> /u/Competitive_Speech36 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/146zizf/how_cios_approach_automation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/146zizf/how_cios_approach_automation/">[comments]</a></span></description>

Click/move cursor/click etc and repeat. </p> <p>The problem I have found with the extensions I have tested is that they all seem to tie automated actions to DIV/element names, which makes it unusable for me, as they keep changing.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/madonnaragu"> /u/madonnaragu </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/14591ou/needed_automation_extension_that_can_repeat/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/14591ou/needed_automation_extension_that_can_repeat/">[comments]</a></span></description>

                <title>Automating a Daily Alert to Get Up from the Desk and Stretch</title>
                <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/143e0f7/automating_a_daily_alert_to_get_up_from_the_desk/</link>
                <description><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks,</p> <p>Like some of you, I often find myself so immersed in my work that I unintentionally spend several hours sitting down. To tackle this, I came up with a project which I believe could be helpful to others in the community who face the same situation. Here's the link to the project details: <a href="https://www.shipyardapp.com/blog/turning-your-peloton-data-into-a-personal-fitness-reminder-a-data-driven-approach/"><strong>https://www.shipyardapp.com/blog/turning-your-peloton-data-into-a-personal-fitness-reminder-a-data-driven-approach/</strong></a></p> <p>Basically, I've put together a setup that sends me a daily alert to stretch if I haven't done so already. Here's a quick rundown:</p> <ul> <li>I use Python to fetch my workout data from the Peloton API</li> <li>I clean up this data a bit using Python</li> <li>Next, I upload the data to Snowflake</li> <li>Finally, I've got an alert set up to ping me with an email if I haven't stretched by 1 PM.</li> </ul> <p>I built this whole thing on Shipyard, where I work, but you could probably put it together using any other orchestration tool or just a few scripts.</p> <p>Let me know what you think. If you have any ideas for improvements, I'd love to hear them!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Steven_Johnson34"> /u/Steven_Johnson34 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/143e0f7/automating_a_daily_alert_to_get_up_from_the_desk/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/143e0f7/automating_a_daily_alert_to_get_up_from_the_desk/">[comments]</a></span></description>
